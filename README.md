# AES-Encryption
AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).

FILE 1:
aes_encryption.py
  It take 2 input : (1) Key of length 16 and can contains Hexa values(0-F) (2) A text which is to be encrypted and it should contain only Hexa values(0-F).
  
FILE 2:
aes_decryption.py
  It take 2 input : (1) Key of length 16 and can contains Hexa values(0-F) (2) A text which is to be decrypted and it should contain only Hexa values(0-F).
  
FILE 3:
  aes_key.py
    It takes 1 input : Key of length 16 and can contains Hexa values(0-F) and returns key for each round required for encryption and decryption.
